# ESP32-Lorawan
ESP32 Lorawan beehive connected

This project is to make a connected hive that can control the weight, the internal and external temperature of the hive as well as the humidity. Data recovery is done with a Lora RFM95 module and reception of this data through a gateway connected to TTN. The data received on TTN is then sent to Node-red and sent back to Blynk's servers.
